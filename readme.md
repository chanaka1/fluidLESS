## File list

- **example/** contains the source of the fluidLESS site.
- **index.html** contains the required markup (namely the meta viewport tag) and a simple demo.
- **fluid.less** is the [LESS](http://lesscss.org/) stylesheet minus the variables. It offers some customization for power users, and works as a nice starting point for LESS users.
- **custom.less** is the [LESS](http://lesscss.org/) variables for fluid.less.
- **fluid.js** contains Golden Gridlet, a script that overlays the fluidLESS grid and a baseline grid of 1.5em onto the page. Can be customized around the top of the file. Powered by the [Ender library](http://ender.no.de/).
